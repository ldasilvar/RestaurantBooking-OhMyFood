# Open Classrooms Project Three OhMyFood

https://ldasilvar.github.io/RestaurantBooking-OhMyFood/

Ohmyfood is a new startup that wants to make a name for itself in the restaurant business. The objective is to develop a 100% mobile-friendly site that lists the menus of gourmet restaurants. In addition to having a classic reservation system, customers will be able to select the dishes they want for their meal so that they are ready when they arrive. No more wait times in restaurants!

Static website designed for client using HTML and SASS, implementing the required animations on hover. 
The website is fully optimized for mobile and tablet views with a dynamic display.
